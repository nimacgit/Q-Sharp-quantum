   Given an array, returns a function which returns elements of that
   array.
remarks: >2-
   This function is mainly useful for interoperating with functions and
   operations that take `Int -> 'T` functions as their arguments. This
   is common, for instance, in the generator representation library,
   where functions are used to avoid the need to record an entire array
   in memory.
syntax: "function LookupFunction (array : 'T[]) : (Int -> 'T)"
input:
  content: "(array : 'T[])"
  types:
  - name: array
    summary: >2
       The array to be represented as a lookup function.
    uid: "'T"
    isLocal: true
    isArray: true
output:
  content: (Int -> 'T)
  types:
  - summary: >2
       A function `f` such that `f(idx) == f[idx]`.
