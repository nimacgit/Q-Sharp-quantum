   Given a preparation and measurement, estimates the frequency
   with which that measurement suceeds (returns `Zero`) by
   performing a given number of trials.

       The number of times that the measurement should be performed

output:
  content: Double
  types:
  - summary: >2-
       An estimate $\hat{p}$ of the frequency with which
       $M(P(\ket{00 \cdots 0}\bra{00 \cdots 0}))$ returns `Zero`,
       obtained using the unbiased binomial estimator $\hat{p} =
       n\_{\uparrow} / n\_{\text{measurements}}$, where $n\_{\uparrow}$ is
       the number of `Zero` results observed.

       This is particularly important on target machines which respect
       physical limitations, such that probabilities cannot be measured.
