summary: >2
   Performs a single-qubit process tomography measurement in the Pauli
   basis, given a particular channel of interest.
remarks: >2-
   The distribution over results returned by this operation is a special
   case of two-qubit state tomography. Let $\rho = J(\Lambda) / 2$ be
   the Choi–Jamiłkowski state for $\Lambda$. Then, the distribution above
   is identical to
   $$
   \begin{align}
       \Pr(\texttt{Zero} | \rho; M) = \Tr(M \rho),
   \end{align}
   $$
   where $M = 2 (\boldone + P)^\mathrm{T} / 2 \cdot (\boldone + Q) / 2$
   is the effective measurement corresponding to $P$ and $Q$.
