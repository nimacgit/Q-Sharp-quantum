summary: ' Computes canonical residue of `value` modulo `modulus`.'
remarks: >2-
   This function behaves the way a mathematician would expect Mod function to behave,
   as opposed to how operator `%` is behaving in C# and Q#.
syntax: 'function Modulus (value : Int, modulus : Int) : Int'

       Integer r between 0 and `modulus - 1' such that `value - r' is divisible by modulus
