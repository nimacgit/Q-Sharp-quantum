uid: microsoft.quantum.canon.bindca
name: BindCA
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: >2
   Given an array of operations acting on a single input,
   produces a new operation that
   performs each given operation in sequence.
   The modifier 'CA' indicates that all operations in the array are adjointable
   and controllable.
remarks: >2

  ### Examples
   The following are equivalent:
   ```Q#
   let bound = Bind([U; V]);
   bound(x);

   U(x); V(x);
   ```
syntax: "function BindCA (operations : ('T => () : Adjoint, Controlled)[]) : ('T => () : Adjoint, Controlled)"
input:
  content: "(operations : ('T => () : Adjoint, Controlled)[])"
  types:
  - name: operations
    summary: >2
       A sequence of operations to be performed on a given input.
